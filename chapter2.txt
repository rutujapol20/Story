aliens roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill alien makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what alien tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With aliens
